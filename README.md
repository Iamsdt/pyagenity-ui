# Agentflow Playground

> The visual playground for **Agentflow** — a production-grade framework for building multi-agent AI systems.

Agentflow gives you everything you need to ship real multi-agent applications: graph-based orchestration, LLM-agnostic model support (OpenAI, Google GenAI, Anthropic), a 3-layer memory system (Redis cache + Postgres + vector store), live agents, parallel tool execution, and native MCP support — backed by a full ecosystem of backend, API, SDK, and UI.

This playground is the React + Vite frontend for testing and interacting with an Agentflow backend through `@10xscale/agentflow-client`. Spin up a server with `agentflow play` and explore your agents visually.

> **⚠️ Temporary local client link.** `@10xscale/agentflow-client` is currently
> installed from the local monorepo path (`file:../agentflow-client`) because the
> latest client (with WebSocket streaming, `stopGraph`/`fixGraph`) is not yet
> published to npm. Rebuild it with `npm run build` in `../agentflow-client` after
> changes. **Once published, swap the dependency in `package.json` back to a
> versioned range** (e.g. `"^0.2.0"`) and remove this note. Until then, the `ws`
> transport in the chat UI is marked *coming soon* and disabled.
